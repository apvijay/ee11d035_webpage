<h2>The IF factor</h2>
"An integrating factor is a function that is chosen to facilitate the solving of a given equation involving differentials."[1]

I was like 'Hey this is jujubi[2] matter', when I was asked to be one of the invigilators for a quiz. But it turned out to be a problem which had all the qualifications to be taken as a topic for research.

The invigilating factors.

You go to the hall at 8.45 and find that it is locked to your amusement. You check your watch; it does show 8.45, and the exam starts at 9.00. You run to your professor's room and collect the bunch of papers (questions and blank) and also the key to the hall. You run back to the hall breathing at a rate of T= 0.9s.

There are 3 other TAs. The hall is a tall and skinny 22x5 matrix and the student strength is certainly not sparse. There are four vertical passages and two horizontal passages for the invigilators to walk.

Each of the other three took one vertical passage each(passages 2,3 and 4).  You are left with one vertical or two horizontals. You are basically lazy to walk and select the horizontal at the back. You happily walk left-right for five minutes. A student raises his left hand in the front-left bench -- his right one writing. You still continue to walk left-right happily. After some 15 seconds, you see the other guys[3]. They give a look like, 'Hey dude, that's your column'. You  walk like an olympian to reach the guy in the front.

At the next quiz, you talk to the other invigilators beforehand about how to segment the hall and share the cake-pieces. Three TAs should walk up and down the verticals, and the fourth at the back horizontal. Every six minutes, the horizontal guy should take the left-out vertical, and one of the vertical guys should take the back horizontal. This will go as a round-robin. One guy in your column raises his hand, and you walk towards him with a smile. You give an additional sheet to him. He declines and says, 'Sir, there is a dog under my desk'. You are like, 'What, how'.

You can either ask him to ignore the dog, or shoo the dog out. And the decision should be taken within 2s -- the guy having a 'Neeyellam oru TA'[4] look at you. Blood undergoes a Browninan motion in your brain.You think that it is better to shoo the dog out. But, you remember that the IIT dogs give a paavam[5] look most of the times, but you don't know about its transient response when the input is an impulse shoo. If the response is zero and if it ignores your shout, then you will feel like a dunce and hundred eyes will give a namuttu[6] smile at you. If the transient response is bad, then it is certainly possible that you have to visit the institute hospital. You decide to ignore the dog and ask the informer to do the same.

The professor comes ten minutes before the time is over, and asks the students to tie up their sheets. He announces for the nth time that everyone should attach the question paper along with the answer sheet.

The time is over. Three students are still nibbing down their papers. You go and stand near one of them. You say, 'fast'. He ignores. One minute pass by. You say, 'I can give you one more minute'. He ignores. One minute pass by. You keep your hand near his answer sheet. He says, 'Please, please, please'. Professor asks you to collect. He says that he needs to tie the paper. He says that there is no thread. You go to the table to bring one. Now that his strategy worked, he continues his writing.

All answer sheets have been collected; you compare the count with the number of signatures. You hand over the bunch to the professor. Other TAs leave. The professor asks you to lock the hall and give the key to him in his room, and leaves. You switch off all the lights and fans. You feel like, 'Habbada, it's done'. When you are just about to close the door, you remember about it. You go near the desk and check. It is sleeping happily still. You are waiting for it to wake up.
